🧭 Step 1 — Clarify the goal

You want a portfolio project (social feed / microblog) built with:

Backend: JHipster monolith (Spring Boot, JWT auth, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch)

Frontend: React (generated by JHipster)

Features: Users, follows, posts, likes, comments, timeline feed

This project should demonstrate you can design, implement, test, and ship a complete system.

🧭 Step 2 — Project skeleton (Day 1–2)

Install JHipster CLI, Docker, Java 17, Maven, Node/Yarn.

Generate base project:

jhipster

Pick monolith, JWT, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, React.

Run the base app (./mvnw) and verify you can:

Register/login,

Access Swagger UI at /swagger-ui.

👉 At this point you already have:

User entity, JWT auth, DB config, front-end skeleton.

🧭 Step 3 — Entities (Day 3–4)

Write a JDL file (I gave you one earlier).

Import it:

jhipster import-jdl social.jdl

This gives you entities: Post, Follow, Comment, PostLike.

Run app again → Liquibase creates tables.

Play in Swagger UI: create a Post, see DB rows in Postgres.

👉 At this point:

DB schema done.

Entities exist, but logic is missing (e.g. timeline, likes counters).

🧭 Step 4 — Business logic (Day 5–7)

This is where my earlier code fits in. Pick one slice at a time:

Posting

Add PostService (save + event).

Add PostResource (REST endpoint).

Test: POST a post in Swagger UI → DB entry created.

Follow

Add FollowRepository methods.

Add FollowController (/api/users/{id}/follow).

Test: one user follows another.

Timeline

Add RedisFeedService (get timeline).

Add RedisPushWorker (async event listener).

Test: User B posts → User A’s /timeline shows it.

👉 Do one feature per day. Don’t try to wire everything at once.

🧭 Step 5 — Testing (Day 8–10)

Unit tests: services (likes increment, comment add).

Integration test with Testcontainers (I gave you one): verifies end-to-end.

Run mvn test and get green.

🧭 Step 6 — Frontend (Day 11–14)

In src/main/webapp/app:

Add Timeline page: fetch /api/timeline.

Add Post composer: POST /api/posts.

Add Follow button: call /api/users/{id}/follow.

Add Like button: POST /api/posts/{id}/like.

👉 At this point: you have a usable demo.

🧭 Step 7 — Ship (Day 15–20)

Add Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml.

Push to GitHub.

Add GitHub Actions CI to run tests + build image.

Deploy (optional) to Render/Heroku/AWS.

🧭 Step 8 — Extras (Day 20+)

Add Elasticsearch search endpoint (/api/search/posts?q=).

Add rate limiting with Bucket4j.

Add metrics (Micrometer, Prometheus).

💡 Mental model

Think of the project as layers:

Foundation: JHipster skeleton + DB + Auth (done in 1 day).

Entities: JDL → Post, Follow, etc. (done in 1–2 days).

Features: one feature per day (post → follow → timeline → like → comment).

Tests: prove features work.

Frontend: React UI for the features.

Ship: Docker + GitHub Actions.

Don’t jump to “integration test + CI + Redis push worker” before you can POST a Post and see it in the DB. That’s the first milestone.
